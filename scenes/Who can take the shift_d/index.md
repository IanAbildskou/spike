 - Title: Feedback on choice D: Achmed

# Description
*Your response:*

Achmed? - When you him asked the first time, he pointed out that its Friday tomorrow, and that he had planned to visit his mosque. 

*Feedback:*

Picking Achmed was a poor choice as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. So it demonstrated a poor understanding of his cultural values. 
In this case, he would have said yes to your request - but it would have made him feel bad, so it there was a large price on his engagement to be paid. 

Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem with this are that you often end up asking the same few people which can make your most flexible people feel misused.   

You could also safely have asked Jonas (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?) 

Asking Lilly or Jonas lead to the same score. 

But great that you did not give up. That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 



*Outcome:*

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed  in Achmed's engagement (-2) as you spent some time convincing Achmed to accept (-1 on Resources)
