 - Title: Feedback on choice C: Ask no-one

# Description
*Your response:*

No-one? - Though it's likely to cost a slightly lower output tomorrow, this is what happens from time to time.

*Feedback:*

You gave up too early! That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 

Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem with this are that you often end up asking the same few people which can make your most flexible people feel misused.   

You could also have tried Jonas (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?) 

Asking Lilly or Jonas was the best choices, and lead to the same score. 

But it was good that you did not pick Achmed, as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. 



*Outcome:*

You experienced a negative effect in output (-4). No effect on neither engagement nor resource spend.
