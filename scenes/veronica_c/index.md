 - Title: Feedback on choice C (Veronica)


# Description
*Your response:*

Invite her to a meeting formally about a project that you are both involved with – but during the conversation turn to the real subject of concern.
Start by letting her know how well she is performing – but also bring your concerns up directly, offering to spend time and effort in figuring out how to best handle the challenge.

*Feedback:*

Great approach. Good to open such a conversation where you can make it part of another topic.
It makes it feel natural – and secures that Veronica does not get to concerned in advance of the conversation.

*Outcome:*

You experienced an increase in both engagement (+3) as well as  Performance (+3)
