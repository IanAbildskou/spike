 - Title: Feedback on choice B: Jonas

# Description
*Your response:*

Jonas! 
- When you him asked the first time, he really wanted to help, but couldn't because he had promised to drive his son to the dentist tomorrow

*Feedback:*

Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused.    

So you decided to try with Jonas, which was a good call (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?) 

Asking Lilly or Jonas lead to the same score. 

But it was good that you did not pick Achmed, as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. 

Also good that you did not pick to give up. That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 

So - all in all: A good choice - though such situations are never fun. 


*Outcome:*

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Jonas's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Jonas to accept (-1 on Resources)
