 - Title: Feedback on choice A: Lilly

# Description
*Your response:*

Lilly! 
When you her asked the first time, she answered that she had already taken on two extra shifts in the past 3 weeks, so she did not want to take another one! (but you have a sense that you could talk her into itâ€¦)

*Feedback:*

You probably picked Lilly because you sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. The problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused.   

But, in all fairness, you did not have many good choices. It would have been just as good if you had asked Jonas - maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist? 

Asking Lilly or Jonas lead to the same score. 

But it was good that you did not pick Achmed, as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. 

Also good that you did not pick to give up. That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 

So - all in all: A good choice - though such situations are never fun. But next time, ask Jonas - so it's not always Lilly that solves the problem. 


*Outcome:*

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Lilly's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Lilly to accept (-1 on Resources)
